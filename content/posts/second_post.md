# Project Blog

Welcome to a deep dive into the world of keyloggers and our journey of building a keylogger project. In this blog post, we'll provide insights into what a keylogger is, its potential applications, and how our project aims to approach this technology responsibly.

# Understanding Keyloggers

A keylogger is a software tool designed to record and log keystrokes on a computer or device. It can capture every keystroke made by a user, including passwords, messages, and other sensitive information. While keyloggers have both legitimate and potentially malicious uses, our focus is on exploring their functionality and raising awareness about their ethical use.

# The Purpose of Our Project

Our keylogger project is not aimed at promoting any unethical activities or invading anyone's privacy. Instead, we intend to highlight the significance of cybersecurity and the importance of understanding potential vulnerabilities in software systems.

# Building the Keylogger

### Technical Approach

Our keylogger project is built using Python. It is designed to run in the background, capturing keystrokes and storing them securely.
